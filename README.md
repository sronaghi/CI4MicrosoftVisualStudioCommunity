# CI4MicrosoftVisualStudioCommunity
This documentation is for the continuous integration of Enspectra Healthâ€™s codebase using CircleCI. The script (config.yml) is in the .circleci  folder of the circleci-project-setup branch in the sasha-pathwand-source Github repository. This is the branch which connects the Github repository and the circleci-project-setup branch. This branch is used so that updates to the config.yml file can be made without an impact on the other branch in this repository, the main branch. 

The purpose of this script is to automate the build process of a Visual Studio .sln file and publish a release on Github of the artifact files of the build. The build output is being put into a Github release to be able to keep track of changes made to a branch by different contributors.
